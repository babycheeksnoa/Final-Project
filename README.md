## Final Portfolio – by Ainoa H.

## About Me
Hi, I'm Ainoa H., a student developer with a growing passion for web development and digital design. This year, I’ve been learning the core principles of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and discovering how to build clean, functional, and creative web experiences. I enjoy exploring design choices, solving layout challenges, and bringing personality into every project I create.

## Project Overview
This portfolio is the final project for my web development coursework and represents everything I’ve learned and built throughout the year. From responsive layouts to hands-on coding techniques, I’ve gained experience in turning ideas into interactive, visually engaging web pages. This project gave me the opportunity to reflect on my progress and showcase how my skills have developed.
